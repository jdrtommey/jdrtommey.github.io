Welcome to the homepage for the MAgPIE 24 conference.

After a one year break we will have our next MAgPIE workshop & stories event mid of April this year. This time we will organize it in a hybrid format hosted on the Telegrafenberg at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research. During this 3 day event we will have a mix of an introduction workshop for the MAgPIE model and the underlying MADRaT data processing framework as well as two MAgPIE stories sessions in which current users and developers of the model present their most recent work.

Course fee is 280€ for in-person participation with a total of 20 tickets available and 50€ for online participation with another 30 tickets available. The registration for the workshop is now open: -> <a href = "./registration.html">click here</a> <-. A call for contributions for the MAgPIE stories event will follow soon and does not require a workshop registration (online participation primarily enivisioned).
